description: Evolving in a world where everything is accelerating, especially in terms of employability and its indispensable skills for tomorrow, I decided to learn several languages, R with its many packages (18966) and Python for its many possibilities (application development, big data, ...). My website dedicated mainly to R and Python aims at retracing my learning of this fantastic language and also to share with all people wondering or wishing to learn this fabulous statistical tool or simply to complete the missing information of this site. More modestly, I have the secret hope that some professional barriers will disappear, especially by showing that in each one of us, innumerable facets and competences are available, a priori antinomic. To each and every one of you, I wish you a maximum of pleasure while browsing this site.
