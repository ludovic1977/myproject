### Comments
This online course explains exactly what tidy data is and how to make it tidy with three case studies.
For example :
- Data transformation (wide datasets long vs long datasets, converting data types in R, working with dates and times,...)
- Transforming variable data (normalizing, transforming data distributions,...)
- Cleaning data(detecting outliers, breaking apart columns, combining columns,...)
