### Comments
This online course goes further than the "Discovering R" course in programming concepts in R. For example :
    - Manipulating datasets (selecting, sorting, renaming columns, creating joins between different datasets)
- Transforming variable data (normalizing, transforming data distributions,...)
- Create simple graphs with ggplot2
- Introduction to data mining and machine learning
- Table production with the Shiny package
