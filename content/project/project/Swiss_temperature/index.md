excerpt: This first published article took a lot of effort and energy to write. For example, some unknown packages were discovered and used. I am referring to ggplot2, hayshader, rmarkdown, distill and of course the website development. I want to thank Alison Hill, senior data scientist at IBM, for the development of Hugo apero. Enjoy reading and discovering!
