Nowadays, it is very difficult to find quality, inexpensive online training courses with professionally recognized certifications.  

There are 3 main players in the online training market:  

1. Coursera
2. LinkedIn Learning
3. Udemy

Thanks to this article entitled ***"Coursera vs. Udemy vs. LinkedIn Learning: Which Is the Best for You?"*** (https://www.makeuseof.com/coursera-vs-udemy-vs-linkedin-learning/) I offer you some tips on how to choose freely according to your learning goals. This article was published on April 3, 2022.
In this blog, I will quote some interesting passages that helped me make my choice (Coursera, LinkedIn).

## Why choose Coursera?
### Instructor Criteria

***Instructors on Coursera are some of the best educators you'll find in the industry***. *You'll find instructors who are Harvard, Princeton, Oxford, or MIT professors. You'll also find instructors who are industry experts from companies like IBM, Google, and Meta. They are experienced in the teaching business, delivering traditional classroom lectures with a few remote learning modifications.*

### Quality Courses

*Of the three, ***Coursera has the strictest quality requirements for courses***. ***Most of Coursera's courses are curated and reviewed by some of the most prestigious educational institutions in the world***. Their courses cover the introductory concepts of a topic, all the way to the more advanced concepts. In a lot of cases, you get the same courses being taught at partner institutions like MIT and Harvard.*

### Enrollment Options

*1. Audit a course: Enroll in thousands of courses free of charge. You'll get a few limitations, including an absence of  certificates and graded tests.*  

*2. Full Course, No Certificate: Unrestricted access to courses, but no certificates.*

*3. Financial aid: Apply for financial aid and, if approved, get access to premium courses plus certificates at no cost.*

*4. Coursera Plus: Pay $399 yearly and get access to thousands of courses and certificates at no additional charge.*

*5. Paid Courses: Pay for individual courses and programs as you go*

### Pricing Options

*The prices of Coursera courses vary extensively. Individual courses are priced between $30 to $100, while some degree programs can cost as much as $20,000. Coursera also offers the Coursera Plus plan, charged at $399 for year-long access to thousands of courses.*

### Course Structure

*Coursera's courses are organized ***much like a traditional university curriculum***. First, you learn the building blocks or foundational concepts of a topic. You then progress gradually into a more in-depth analysis of more advanced concepts. ***It's like the Harvard/MIT experience, but behind a computer screen in your bedroom***. The pace is akin to those used in those institutions as well. This is why some Coursera degree-awarding programs—which are a combination of related courses—may take more than a year to complete.*

### When to Choose Coursera

*1. ***If you need an e-learning experience that is as close as possible*** to what you'd get in a traditional classroom.*  

*2. ***If you want to earn recognized degrees, and possibly, credits***, towards completing a degree in any partner institution.*

*3. ***If you need in-depth education on a subject***.*

*4. If you need slow-paced but ***qualitative education***.*


### My choice

You will have guessed my choice with this blog. **It is Coursera**.
As such, I'm coming off of about 4 weeks of training on an introduction (more than an introduction in my opinion) to Python through the University of Pennsylvania.
