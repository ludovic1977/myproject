title: Launch of my website
---

Welcome to my website.
I thank you for taking the time to discover it. I hope it will bring you some new knowledge. 

My goal is to publish content as regularly as possible. But I have to admit, I'm a beginner in R programming, and all the discoveries and advancements in R programming take me some time. 
I am convinced that taking the time each day to discover the basics of R will allow me to progress quickly. 

This site is here to present you my progress in R. Other tools exist such as LinkedIn. Unfortunately, this "professional" social network is no longer totally a social network and has been transformed over the years into a "facebook".  
Therefore, only the link of my website will be mentioned on my LinkedIn profile.

From time to time, I will publish posts on LinkedIn to indicate that my website exists, for those who wish to follow my progress.
