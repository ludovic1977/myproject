<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My name is Ludovic Perruchoud, I am originally from Switzerland and live in the French speaking part of the country. I have a bachelor's degree in business economics from the HEIG-VD with a background in technology (watch industry). My professional career has been marked by continuous training in parallel to my professional activity. This thirst and need to learn accompanies me every day. :fr:
